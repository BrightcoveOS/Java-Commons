About
=====

This project provides common classes and utilities for use in other Java
projects.  This may include 3rd party libraries as well as Brightcove Open
Source libraries.

Requirements
============

Whenever possible, the libraries will be compatible with Java 1.5, but in
some cases Java 1.6 may be required.  Each commons library should make note
of this.

Package - (3rd party) apache-commons
====================================

This package includes several Apache Commons libraries, including: 
 
- Mime4j (from Apache James project)
- Commons IO
- HTTP Components (core and client)

These can all be downloaded from Apache directly if preferred: 
 
- [Apache Commons](http://commons.apache.org/)
- [Apache James](http://james.apache.org/download.cgi)
- [Apache HTTP Components](http://hc.apache.org/)

The versions stored here will be stripped down to just what is needed (plus any legal / license notifications)

Dependencies: 
 
- None

Package - (3rd party) json-org
==============================

This package is almost entirely just the source code downloaded from json.org
(http://www.json.org/java/index.html) downloaded on January 12th 2011.  The
only changes made are to resolve compiler and/or eclipse warnings.

Package - (3rd party) xalan
===========================

This package will include the Xalan libraries from release version 2.7.1.

This package has not yet been released.

Package - bc-catalog-objects
============================

This package includes classes to represent all of the fundamental data objects produced by or needed to interface with the Brightcove system.

Most of the objects are created following the Brightcove Media API object reference, but some modifications are needed to support other projects.

Package - collection-utils
==========================

This package includes classes to make working with Collections (Sets, Lists, etc) easier.

This package includes classes to make working with HTTP objects (requests, responses, entities, etc) easier.

Dependencies:

Package - system-utils
==========================

This package includes classes to make working with the underlying system (e.g. sys exec calls) easier.

Dependencies: 
 
- None
